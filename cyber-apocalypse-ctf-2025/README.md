![image](img/EventBanner.jpg)

This folder contains my personal writeups and exploit scripts for the Cyber Apocalypse CTF 2025, hosted by Hack The Box. The focus is on the three blockchain challenges from the event, which I successfully solved.

This was my **first CTF competition**, and I'm proud to have completed all of the blockchain challenges. It was a great experience that motivated me to dive even deeper into smart contract security.
